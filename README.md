<h3>1.Overview</h3>
Data warehousing is a phenomenon born out of the enormous amount of electronic data stored in recent years and the urgent need to use this data to achieve objectives that go beyond the routine tasks associated with daily processing. 
To meet the needs of managers, custom queries can be issued to retrieve the required data. For this process to work, database administrators must first formulate the desired query after carefully studying the database catalogs. Then the query is processed. This can take a few hours due to the huge amount of data, the complexity of the queries and the simultaneous effects of other regular workload queries on the data. Finally, a report is generated and sent to senior management in the form of a spreadsheet.

Sakila sample database was designed to replace the world database, also provided by Oracle. The development of the Sakila database started in early 2005. The first designs were based on the database used in the Dell white paper Three Approaches to MySQL Applications on Dell PowerEdge Servers. While the Dell database was designed to represent an online DVD store.
